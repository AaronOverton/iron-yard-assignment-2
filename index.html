    <h1>Totally Iron Yarding</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Lefterly Stuff</h2>
        <p>When I'm looking at things on the left side of the screen, there are a number of aspects I find important.</p>
        <p>Perhaps I should name a few? I think I'll do that, with an unordered list. Unordered because I don't really know that it matters what comes first.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It should be on the left</li>
            <li>There really ought to be another thing on the right</li>
            <li>It would be grand if it also had an ordered list</li>
            <li>Maybe I'll add one on the right</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So in conclusion, a kitten.</p>
        <p><img src="http://placekitten.com/g/600/300" /></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Righterly Stuff</h2>
        <p>Now I can also include some things that I'll make totally on the right. If I were to keep going, I'd also make sure to include some media queries so that these can be top and bottom on smaller devices. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is the first assignment</li>
            <li>I didn't add responsiveness</li>
            <li>This gets across the point without added complexity</li>
            <li>Now I also have an ordered list, too!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>One last thing: I'm using a couple Google Fonts so I can have a more attractive layout. I'm also using a serif typeface for the headings and a san serif typeface for the body.</p>
        <blockquote>Yes, they are typefaces. "Font" refers to the file, "typeface" to the letter design. A nitpick, I know.</blockquote>
        <p>This kind of contrast improves the overall design of the page, yet is very simple to implement.</p>
        <p>I'm going to add one more line just to make the columns even.</p>
    </div>
